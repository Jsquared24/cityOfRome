	title="Agrippina: an historiographical approach"
	abstract="This short presentation will focus upon Personalities in their Times. Option J --- Agrippina the Younger. The HSC Stage 6 Syllabus Guidelines suggest that we focus, <span class='emph'>inter alia</span>, on 'ancient and modern images' of the woman, and upon one particular source, evaluating it in the context of other available sources. With regard to Agrippina it is hard to ignore Tacitus who offers an excellent case study in the ways the past can be reconstructed, the reasons why it is studied, and the prejudices that frequently mark the exercise. Tacitus' vivid narrative will be dissected (with regard to key episodes) and compared with the contemporary (primary) data (coins and inscriptions)."

	title="Pompeii &ndash;  reconstructing &amp; conserving the past"
	abstract="The syllabus for Pompeii within the HSC demands that students 'analyse issues relating to the ownership, custodianship and conservation of the ancient past' (AH12-10). This area is something of a challenge and it is with this in mind that this talk is offered. The documentation produced by UNESCO will be shown to provide students with clear evidence, from which they may develop analyses of ownership, custodianship and conservation of the site. These documents have a richness to them that identifies problems of conservation, and the solutions that UNESCO feel will be needed to resolve them.  This approach allows teachers and students to engage with the wider issue -- what is Pompeii for?  Answers to this question are contained in the designation by UNESCO of the 'universal value' of Pompeii to all inhabitants of the world.  The concerns of UNESCO over the management and conservation at Pompeii are also documented and published. Further material from which students can use to make their cases with regard to ethics, conservation, and responsibilities of the Italian state."

	title="Silver and Sandals: Social Justice and the Hebrew Bible (SoR)"
	abstract="In the opening chapters of the Book of Amos, the prophet gives an angry polemic against Israel for selling the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes. The focus on social justice in Amos reflects the centrality of ethics in the Hebrew Bible. From the Ten Commandments to the Prophetic Vision, ethical considerations are at the very heart of Judaism. God's identification as compassionate (Exodus 34), is reflected in concern for the socially disadvantaged in the Ten Commandments and the Prophetic Books, such as Amos. Along with forming a central part of the Decalogue, the emphasis on social justice is reflected in the concept of 'Tikkun Olam' (the repair of the world). In the core ethical teachings of Judaism, compassion and social justice are a vital part of the community of Israel's intimate relationship with God in the past, present, and future."

	title="Lake Mungo: the deep time history of its people"
	abstract="Lake Mungo is known the world over as the burial place of Mungo Lady and Mungo Man, the oldest-known representatives of the First Australians. However, buried in the lunette bounding Lake Mungo are thousands of traces of past human activity: the remains of fireplaces, burned food remains, and scatters of stone, bone and shell tools that were once the mainstay of everyday life. These are preserved in sediments that span most of the known history of human settlement in Australia and their study is yielding new insights into the changing pattern of life on the edge of the continent's arid core."
