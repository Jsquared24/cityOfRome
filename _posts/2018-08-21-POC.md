Built in **55BC**, at least according to the Roman historian [_Velleius Paterculus_](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#48/ "A Roman Historian of the first century AD"), the structure comprises of **four** main components:  

* Theatre
* _curia_
* Temple
* _quadriporticus_

It is an example of spectacular Roman architecture

[Ray Laurence](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/ray-laurence) in
the Department of Ancient History is co-editor (with [Mary
Harlow](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/people/academics/harlow)
-- [University of
Leicester](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/people/academics/harlow))
of the first volume of *The Cultural History of Shopping* dealing with
antiquity. Interestingly, the chapters and their focus are set so that
this volume and the other five volumes, which take the cultural history
of shopping right up to the end of the twentieth century, have the same
shape -- a key feature of this [Bloomsbury series of Cultural
Histories](https://www.bloomsburyculturalhistory.com/cultural-history-series).
Thus, there will be discussions of children and shopping, gendered
shopping, the regulation of goods, and the nature of trust within the
world of retail. The end result will be a book that not only brings
shopping into the study of ancient history, but also enables the reader
to compare the character of shopping in this time period with its
development in later historical periods.
