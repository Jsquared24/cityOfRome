## An Excerpt from Paul's Talk:
    
> And here's what you do [slide]. The first year is described as including 'advanced undergraduate' work, but you have to have a degree to get in. The other thing you have to do is 'Research Frontiers'. 
>
> Now, there is an equivalent block red screen on the website for the Master of Ancient History, so I can't claim that away from the royal road we look a lot more exciting; but here's the thing. Every year people come to me who are finishing the Master of Ancient History degree, and they ask, 'What can I do next?' and 'Can I move from here to the PhD?' 
>
> The answer to that last question is maybe, but I'm bringing this up really early in this talk because if what you are dreaming of is the highest studies in Ancient History, and if you're dreaming of an academic career, the Master of Ancient History isn't where you start. You really must get into the Master of Research. If like Adam Smith you believed the story market forces were telling you, you'd realize this, because for the MRes degree we don't charge fees, and if you are undertaking the BPhil/MRes as a domestic full-time candidate you will be eligible in the first year for a stipend of $8000. That is, we pay you to study. Naturally the money comes from Canberra, and it comes because it's the government's priority to get people on the research training pathway. 
>
> For the Master of Research, if you're a full-time domestic student, the estimated annual fee is AUD $19,680. No Commonwealth Supported Places are available. In brief, for this degree, you pay us megabucks. 
>
> Of course it's worth it, and that brings me back to the theme of the Master of Ancient History degree [slide]. You start with a completed bachelor degree, but you don't have to have a major in Ancient History. You don't have to study an ancient language (which you do, in order to get into the MRes). As long as your bachelor degree includes some units about the ancient world, I'll be glad to admit you to the MAncHist. If not, you have to start by enrolling in the Graduate Certificate in Ancient History.
