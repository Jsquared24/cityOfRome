Participant Information and Consent Form

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Name of Project: <strong>Machine Learning: a novel method to assess the impact of professional development on teacher classroom practice</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>You are invited to participate in a study of the influence of professional development on teacher classroom practice. The purpose of the study is to identify, understand and evaluate the effectiveness of targeted curriculum based professional development for NSW Ancient History and Studies of Religion teachers. The project sets out to answer the following questions: 1. To what extent did the conference build knowledge and skills?, and, 2. How did the conference change teacher practice in the classroom?</p>



<p>The study is being conducted by,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dr Kim Wilson</strong>, The Department of Educational Studies -- Macquarie University. Phone: +61 2 9850 9337. Email: kim.wilson@mq.edu.au </li>
<li><strong>Dr Gillan Davis</strong>, The Department of Ancient History -- Macquarie University. Phone: +61 2 9850 7789. Email: gil.davis@mq.edu.au</li>
<li><strong>Dr Brian Ballsun-Stanton</strong>, The Department of Ancient History -- Macquarie University. Phone: +61 2 9850 7084. Email: brian.ballsun-stanton@mq.edu.au </li>
<li><strong>Dr Iain Hay</strong>, The Department of Educational Studies -- Macquarie University. Phone +61 2 9850. Email iain.hay@mq.edu.au</li>
</ul>



<p>If you decide to participate, you will be asked to:</p>
 <ul>
<li> Complete a pre-conference survey. Anticipated time needed to complete the survey is 10&nbsp;minutes.</li>
 <li>Allow us to anonymously use and analyse&nbsp;your self-reflection answers written as part of your Professional Development asessment and to complete a post-conference survey at the conclusion of the conference. Anticipated time needed to complete the answers and the&nbsp;survey is 30 minutes over multiple interactions.</li>
 <li>Complete a follow-up survey approximately three months after the Conference delivery. Anticipated time needed to complete the survey is 15 minutes.</li>
</ul>
 



<p>
Any information or personal details gathered in the course of the study are confidential, except as required by law. No individual will be identified in any publication of the results. Dr Brian Ballsun-Stanton is the only researcher who will have access to raw data. De-identified processed data will be used in the project study. Processed data and the machine learning analysis code will be available to all on <a href="https://osf.io/x3vpn/">https://osf.io/x3vpn/</a> as soon as processing is completed. Any publication arising from the study will be linked&nbsp;to all conference participants via email address provided for conference registration. This is a pilot proof of concept for a larger study that will examine the efficacy of professional development over time for secondary school History and Studies of Religion teachers.</p>


 

<p>Our research is trialling the use of Machine Learning (ML) for the processing of data collection. We wish to collect data with minimal burden to teachers. ML will enable the generation of compatible data sets that can be used to design a more in-depth study of the efficacy of professional development in secondary education. We would hope to use the processed data collected from this study in a future longitudinal study.</p>


 

<p>Participation in this study is entirely voluntary: you are not obliged to participate and if you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw at any time without having to give a reason and without consequence.</p>




<p>The ethical aspects of this study have been approved by the Macquarie University Human Research Ethics Committee. If you have any complaints or reservations about any ethical aspect of your participation in this research, you may contact the Committee through the Director, Research Ethics &amp; Integrity (telephone (02) 9850 7854; email ethics@mq.edu.au. Any complaint you make will be treated in confidence and investigated, and you will be informed of the outcome.</p></ul>
